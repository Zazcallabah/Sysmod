All code is placed in src/ folder. Build by opening Sysmod.sln in Visual Studio 2008 and choosing the Build Solution option. Test for model verification can be run if the version of Visual studio is Team Edition.

For your convenience a prepared build is placed in bin/ folder.

If you are not used to looking at larger C# projects, all essential code files have been placed in the help/ folder. These will not build, and might differ slightly from the ones in src/ folder, but most of the clutter in src/ folder has been removed. (Comments and basic code structure has been preserved.)

Gathered data and graphs are located in the data/ folder.

Documents refered to in the report are stored in the doc/ folder.
